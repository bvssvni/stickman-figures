stickman-figures
================

A place where users of Stickman &amp; Elemento can share figures.

This is how you get started (it is free):

1. Create an account on Github.
2.Visit the link above.
3. Click "Clone on Windows" to download software.
4. Put the destination in the My Documents\stickman\packages and a new folder.

The last step is optional if you don't want to use the Add Stickman dialogue.

GitHub will make it easy to share figures that you want to share with everybody.
It is the first time I attempt to use it with multiple people,
so it will be a learning experience for me as well.

My idea of structure is as following:
1. Each person gets a folder with their name which they can organize as they like.
If we find a clever way to do organize it differently, or work in a group,
we can create new folders.
2. Since each person have their unique style,
it is logical to browse the figures this way to find parts that fit together.
3. All figures can change over time, so if you like something or use it in a project,
you need a copy of it.
4. Maximum file size 100 KB per file.
We need to keep the repository small.
